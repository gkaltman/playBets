Running the application:

Use Java 8.

java -jar playWithBets.jar

By default the app starts on localhost:8001. If you wanna change the port:
java -jar playWithBets.jar httpserver.port=8002

If you look in the code, starting point: class AppStarter.

Design choices:
1. Because the application is CPU bound, the number of threads used to serve requests is set to Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors().
2. In order to minimize memory, for each bet offer we keep a max of 20 (or other value) stakes. The highest.
3. In order to maximize performance, the stakes for a betoffer are kept in a TreeSet, the add and remove operations are O(n).
4. Because the stakes are kept forever and the specification does not show any way to release memory, a circuit breaker was added.
The implemented circuit breaker is dummy (stop accepting stake posts if the number of stakes exceeds a hardcoded threashold).
5. In order to improve performance in a multi-threaded environement, ReentrantReadWriteLock were used. Many readers in the same time.


Libraries:
1. For the http server, I used what was in spec com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer.
2. For testing, I used junit and httpclient.
